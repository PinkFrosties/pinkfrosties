    <h1>Kevin's rabbit hole</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Kevin, you've just set foot on the <strong>(Insert name here)</strong>, a subset of my personal thoughts & ideas, ongoing and finished projects. Feel free to explore by clicking on the hyperlinks. </p>
    <p>For now, this website (or blog if you want) is still <em>work in progress</em>. The idea would be to post all notes and projects that I have and find a way to link them together.
      You might wonder why anybody would want to publish his thoughts, projects or even his code? The reasoning is pretty simple, I'm an advocate for free knowledge and open data.
      Everything I learn or create should be accessible by all for free, so feel free to use my code, data, or even blog info!
      Feel free to contact me by <a href="mailto:k.okan.pahud@gmail.com">email</a> or <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='external' href="https://twitter.com/qwevino_0" rel='noopener noreferrer'>twitter</a>.

    <h2>About myself</h2>
    <p>I'm an energy engineer and analyst (some say data scientist) in the energy&climate sector who enjoys everything related to energy, climate and space.
        I'm particularly interested in vizualising and explaining subjects through open data and graphs, to help understand issues related to climate change. 
        During my free time, I read, play video-games and enjoy twitter (maybe too much).
    </p>
    <p>Why this name? As this website is underwork and will follow up an organic construction with many subsets leading to eachother, it might create loopholes in the end.
    </p>

    <h2> I enjoy working with data...</h2>
    <p>As said, I really enjoy working with data, trying to explore stuff and see what I can get out of it.
         Here's a list of projects I'm currently working on, or finished working on.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Atmospheric pollution: <a href="Org/Env-400.html"> <em>currently under progress</em></a> </li>
        <li>How much music I consume</li>
        <li>Under progress..</li>
        <li>Under progress..</li>
    
    </ul>
    <p>
        <em>
        PS: you can find all the code and sources on my <a href="https://github.com/PinkFrosties" target="_blank" class="external" rel='noopener noreferrer'> github</a>
        </em> 
    </p>
    <h2> ...Taking pictures...</h2>
    <h2> ...Sometimes work on longer pieces...</h2>

    <p>As a good old scientist, I worked on a few subjects and published some scientific articles.
      As they are unfortunately published in academic journals, you might not have access to them, so feel free to write to me so that I can give you a copy. </p>
 <ul>
     <li>The use of space analog missions for education, with the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/" target="_blank" class="external" rel='noopener noreferrer'> link</a></li>
     <li>The EROI, a tool to mesure energy availability through the energy transition</li>
 
 </ul>

    <h2>
        ... And enjoy reading books
    </h2>
      <p>
        I try to read as much as possible, on various subjects, mostly history and geopolitics.
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Books that I have previously <a href="Org/books.html"> read</a>.</li>
          <li> Unending pile of books that I must <a href="Org/books_toread.html"> read</a>.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>I would like to thank Remi, who inspired me to create this website, feel free to explore his
        <a href="https://www.thetypicalset.com/" target="_blank" class="external" rel='noopener noreferrer'>subset</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Wanted a simple design, to essentially focus on the content and not the form, as I believe this is what readers look for.</p>
    <p>This website is forever (literaly) under construction </p>
