    <h1>The loophole set </h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Kevin, you've just set foot on the <strong>(Insert name here)</strong>, a subset of my personal thoughts & ideas, ongoing and finished projects. Feel free to explore </p>
    <p>For now, this website (or blog if you want) is still <em>work in progress</em></p>
    <h2>About myself</h2>
    <p>I'm an energy engineer and analyst (some say data scientist) in the energy&climate sector who enjoys everything related to energy, climate and space.
        I'm particularly interested in vizualising and explaining subjects through open data and graphs, to help understand issues related to climate change. 
        On free time, I read, play video-games and enjoy twitter (maybe too much).
    </p>
    <p>Why this name? As this website is underwork and will follow up an organic construction with many subsets leading to eachother, it might create loopholes in the end.
    </p>
    <h2> I enjoy working with data...</h2>
    <h2> ...Take pictures...</h2>
    <h2> ...Sometimes work on longer pieces...</h2>
    <h2> ...And enjoy Reading</h2>

    <h2> About this website</h2>

    <p>I would like to thank Remi, who inspired me to create this website, feel free to explore his
        <a href="[https://www.thetypicalset.com/](https://www.thetypicalset.com/)" target="_blank">subset</a>.</p>

    <p>Wanted a simple design, to essentially focus on the content and not the form, as I believe this is what readers look for.</p>
    <p>This website is forever (literaly) under construction </p>
