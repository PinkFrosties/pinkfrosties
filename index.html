    <h4> I enjoy performing working with data...</h4>
    <h4> ...Take pictures...</h4>
    <h4> ...Sometimes work on longer pieces...</h4>

    <h4> About this website</h4>
    <p>I would like to thank Remi, who inspired me to create this website, feel free to explore his subset.</p>
    <p>Wanted a simple design, to essentially focus on the content and not the form, as I believe this is what readers look for.</p>
